    The purpose of our project is to develop an advanced system used for file organization
and localization that would integrate seamless with an existing OS. To accomplish that
we will be using a combination of normal search, semantic labeling and Virtual Folders.
Depending on time constraints the project can be further improved with a distributed
component that would allow the same functionality over large networks of computers.
