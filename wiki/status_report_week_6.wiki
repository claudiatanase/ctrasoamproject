Razvan Alecsandrescu: 

- Tasks programmed until 11.13.2008 :
* Database 
* Server 
* Testing 
* Documentation

- Tasks completed (11.11.2008):
* Documentation
* Database
* Server (40%)
* Modules (10%)

I'm on schedule. Actually a little ahead of schedule but I haven't started running into the really difficult problems of this project. And I also rule so that's a plus.

- Encountered problems and changes performed.

No signifiant problems encountered. Spent some time searching for the best method to load classes dynamically ( parsing modules can and will be added to the project later and this shouldn't mean that the project must be rebuilt).

- Self-assesment.
As always yours truly shows outstanding coding skills, motivation and may I say sings of genius. Modesty is another of my qualities.
- Assesment of technologies used
They work. The right tools for the right job.
- ?
Best caching solution for searches and answers.
Best entry point for C code.
