== Development language == 

Java is a programming language developed by Sun in 1995. It shares a lot of its syntax with C and C++ but offers a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilites.
The unique thing about Java at the time when it first appeared is that it was developed in a manner that allows a Java application to be developed on one platform and run on multiple ones. In order to perform this Java source code is compiled into bytecode which can be run ( interpreted ) by different JVM( Java Virtual Machines) operating on different opperating systems.
Another interesting thing about Java is the Garbage Collector an automatic mechanism of memory management in the object lifecycle.The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable object becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use.

The language was extended from its creation and now it is used on various platforms ( even mobile ones) and for different purposes ( web development, desktop apps, etc).

=== Primary goals ===
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
* It should be "simple, object oriented, and familiar".
* It should be "robust and secure".
* It should be "architecture neutral and portable".
* It should execute with "high performance".
* It should be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".

== Apis and frameworks == 

=== Apache Lucene === 

[http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html Apache Lucene] is a free/open source information retrieval library. It is supported by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation Apache Software Foundation] and is released under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_License Apache Software License].
Although originally created for Java it was ported to programming languages including Delphi, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP.

==== Features and common use ====

While suitable for any application which requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene has been widely recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching.
At the core of Lucene's logical architecture is the idea of a document containing fields of text. This flexibility allows Lucene's API to be independent of file format. Text from PDFs, HTML, Microsoft Word documents, as well as many others can all be indexed so long as their textual information can be extracted.

==== Lucene-based projects ====

Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain crawling and HTML parsing functionality. The Apache project Nutch is based on Lucene and provides this functionality; the Apache project Solr is a fully-featured search server based on Lucene; Compass is a Java Search Engine Framework built on top of Lucene.
