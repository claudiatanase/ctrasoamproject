Kernel Space: 

o Kernel module
  + Description:
    # The kernel module will monitor system calls to detect when a file is created, deleted, modified and will create update packets which will be forwarded to the server.
  + Tasks:
    # Additional functionalities will be added as required.

 

User Space:

o Control applications
  + Description:
    # The control application(s) will be C(Python) programs that will interact with the kernel module, server and will offer an interface to the user.
  + Tasks:
    # Allow the user to add/remove files(folders) from the list of monitored files(folders).
    # Allow the user to Create/add tags to files/folders
    # Allow the user to control the kernel module
    # Offer advanced search functionalities to the user
    # Allow the user to control the server.

o Server
  + Description:
    # The main logic of the application resides in the server. The server will process data and add/retrieve it to/from the database.
    # Depending on time constraints additional modules will be added to it in order to act as an distributed server.
    # Modules can be added to the server to allow parsing and indexing of different types of files.
  + Tasks:
    # Use different parsing techniques to obtain relevant information from different types of files in order to generate tags. Example: parse  word documents, mp3 files, pictures (Reading exif information).
    # Submit/request data from the database.
    # Maintain a list of saved Virtual Folders ( cache ) optimize searches.
                         
o Database
  + Description:
    # Holds information about files: tags, indexed text and so on.
    # Can be a distributed database.
