## Problems and changes ##

During an intensive weekend of stuyding the Lucene Api. ( [i recommend this for beginners and more experienced users](http://www.manning.com/hatcher2/) ) I found out that by using more of the Lucene Magic (tm) I can add more functionality to the application.

IE I can implement better and more complex searches, use Lucene to store information about more than text files ( this involves the use of different parsing classes for each type of file) and perhaps increase the performance of the app.

I also found out that Lucene has some distributed features that could really help us in developing the distributed part of our application.

I also stumbled on a very interesting project [Nutch](http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/) which aims at developing an open-source web-search software. The nice part about Nutch is that it already has some very good parsers that I can use.

## Self Assessment ##

Although presently I'm a little behind schedule I'm sure that investing some time in the Lucene/Nutch combo will be beneficial in the end.
